# OldVgDb

A database for video games pre 2000. This project is meant to catalog all these wonderful old video games and experiences which are being lost to time and neglect. I hope this serves as a way to find new fun experiences or to keep these things from being lost.

## How to Use

Just add games to the database using the New Game tab. You will have to find and provide all the information yourself. Once a game is added, you will be redirected to its page, and you can delete, edit or go back to the all games page.
